1;1;1;"Air recirculation causing chatter in system";"Remove air from system." 
1;1;2;"Abrasive matter in the hydraulic oil being circulated through the pump";"Install adequate filter or replace oil more often."
2;1;1;"Pump operated at higher pressures than required";"Reduce pump pressure to minimum required for installation."
2;1;2;"Pump discharging through relief valve";"Remove relief valve. Relief valves are not required with pumps having spring or hydraulic pressure compensating governor (relief valves create additional heat)."
2;2;1;"Wrong type of oil";"Use a good, clean hydraulic oil having the viscosity in accordance with recommendations"
2;2;2;"Low oil level";"Fill reservoir so that surface of oil is well above end of suction line during all of work cycle."
2;2;3;"Pump running too fast";"Reduce speed. Speeds above rating are harmful and cause early failure of pumps. Refer to pump ratings."
2;2;4;"Wrong direction of pump rotation";"Observe arrow on pump case. Direction of rotation must correspond."
3;1;1;"Incorrect piping between control valve and motor";"Check circuit to determine correct piping."
3;2;1;"Free recirculation of oil to reservoir being allowed through system";"Directional control valve may be in open center neutral or other return line unintentionally open. Repair or replace valve."
3;2;2;"Relief valve sticking open";"Remove dirt under pressure adjustment ball or piston."
3;2;3;"System overload relief valve adjustment not set high enough";"Check system pressure and reset relief valve."
4;1;1;"Incorrect valving in circuit";"See circuit drawing for typical booster circuit. Sequence and check valves or adequate substitutes are usually essential in most booster circuits."
4;1;2;"Excessive leakage of high pressure within booster";"Isolate booster to verify source of trouble. Tighten head bolts. Lap or replace four high pressure check valves as needed. If trouble continues, remove heads and inspect ram for scoring. Replace ram and “O” ring assemblies with new parts if needed. Replace rings on small ram. Excessive force may cause spring seat to buckle, jamming check valve."
4;1;3;"Sequence valve incorrectly adjusted";"Tighten pressure adjusting screw sufficiently to prevent booster from operating. With correct pump pressure adjustment, and with operating cylinder at end of stroke, back off adjusting screw until booster operates."
4;2;1;"Pump not delivering oil or developing insufficient pressure";"See pump trouble chart."
4;2;2;"Orifice at ends of control spool plugged with foreign matter";"Remove pipe plugs on both ends of booster body and clean orifice with air or wire."
4;2;3;"Pilot ram or pilot piston are tight or sticking";"Remove plugs outside pilot pistons on each end of booster. Check tightness of rams and pistons with 3/16'' cap screw. Look for dirt or chips. Dress with crocus cloth if necessary."
4;2;4;"Valve closed between pump and booster";"Carefully check piping and valving."
4;2;5;"Sequence valve set too high";"Back off pressure adjusting screw of sequence valve until booster starts to operate."
4;2;6;"Valve closed between booster exhaust and reservoir";"Remove all valving from this line unless the function and operation of such valving is thoroughly understood."
5;1;1;"Cylinder sticking or binding";"Check for dirt, gummy deposits or air leaks as above. Check for misalignment, worn parts or defective packing."
5;1;2;"Valves sticking or binding";" Check for dirt or gummy deposit. Check for contamination of oil. Check for air in system. Check for worn parts. Excessive wear may be due to oil contamination."
5;1;3;"Sluggish operation during warm-up period";"Viscosity of oil too high or pour point too high at starting temperature. Change to oil with lower viscosity or better viscosity index and lower pour point. An immersion heater placed in the oil may help under severe cold conditions."
5;1;4;"Internal leakage in cylinder";"Repair or replace worn parts and loose packing. Check oil to see that viscosity is not too low. Check for excessive contamination or wear."
5;1;5;"Air in system";"Bleed air and check for leaks. Check to see that oil intake is well below surface of oil in reservoir. Check pump packing and line connections on intake side by pouring hydraulic oil over suspected leak. If noise stops, the leak has been located. Tighten joints or change packing or gaskets where necessary."
6;1;1;"Dirt in system";"Drain and flush system. Disassemble and clean, if necessary."
6;1;2;"Restricted drain";"Small fittings or pipe."
6;1;3;"Pilot pressure too low";"Check pilot pressure system."
6;2;1;"Dirt in system";"Disassemble, clean, and flush."
6;2;2;"Blocked drain";"Inspect for plugs or foreign matter."
6;2;3;"Distortion";"Align body and piping to remove strains."
7;1;1;"Air leak in suction line. Air leak around shaft seal";"Pour hydraulic oil on joints and around shaft seal while watching pressure gauge and listening to sound of pump. Steadying of pressure gauge indicates leakage. Replace seal or tighten joints in suction line."
7;1;2;"Restricted filter";"Clean filter. Calculate required size and add 100% for partial blocking by dirt."
7;2;1;"Coupling misalignment";"Re-align pump and motor."
7;2;2;"Electric motor end play";"Do not allow motor shaft to butt up against pump shaft. Allow clearance in coupling."
